## Origin Story
Before attending LearningFuze for web development, I worked as a respiratory therapist and polysomnographic technician. Besides the obvious need to be an effective communicator, I was regularly challenged to think outside of the box. I learned the importance of engaging with others and to view medicine through a different lens. Patients, families and colleagues thanked me for going above and beyond to help, and I was happy knowing that I left them feeling empowered. 

Although I enjoyed my work in the medical field, I often found myself wanting a gratifying and stimulating job solving tough problems and building applications. During COVID-19, the path became clear for me to pursue a career in development. After dedicating a year of over 20 hours a week learning numerous languages and tools, I became a full-stack developer, and am eager to continue growing and pursuing tech.
